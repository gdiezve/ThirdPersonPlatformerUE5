# Third person platformer

This is an Unreal Engine 5 project develop to learn the basics of this Game Engine and how to use blueprints, by implementing a simple game mechanic of collecting some items before the player runs out of time. A Menu was implemented to select the game difficulty.

Here you can find some screenshots of the runnning game:
